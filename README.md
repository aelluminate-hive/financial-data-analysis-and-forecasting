This project analyzes MIGA's income statement data (2012-2024) to understand income sources, expense trends, and predict future performance. Income seems stable, while expenses vary. Time-series forecasting models (Prophet, Random Forest) suggest potential future trends, aiding MIGA in strategic financial planning and resource allocation.
